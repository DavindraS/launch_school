=begin
  ! at the end of a method usually means that it will modify the object calling
  ! also means NOT or negate, so != means not equal
  ? after a method name usually means that the method returns a boolean
  1. != means not equals, and its used with comparisons and branching
  2. ! before something means the opposite of what the thing is
  3. ! after a method means that the method changes the object that called it
  4. ? before something: I'm not sure this is allowed
  5. ? after something means that the thing will return a boolean
  6. !! means not not. ex. !!true = true. !true = false, so !false = true
=end
